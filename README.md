# Poached
A simple mod that adds configurable rewards for killing mobs

Poached will add config options for every mob that is registered under forges registries, so all modded mobs should work as well

Define monetary reward when a player kills a mob. Define ranges for the rewards.

This mod is intended for use on a personal modpack server, as such features will be tailored to integrate with custom FTB mods (FTBLib, FTBUtilities, FTBMoney). THe primary purpose is for rewarding players money for killing mobs, there are other mods out there for controlling mob drops. This may include references to custom code, so this mod may not work in any other setup
